Abstract:

We present a practical approach for implementing the Projected
Tetrahedra (PT) algorithm for interactive volume rendering of
unstructured data using programmable graphics cards. Unlike similar
works reported earlier, our method employs two fragment shaders, one
for computing the tetrahedra projections and another for rendering the
elements. We achieve interactive rates by storing the model in texture
memory and avoiding redundant projections of implementations using
vertex shaders. Our algorithm is capable of rendering over 2.0M Tet/s
on current graphics hardware, making it competitive with recent
ray-casting approaches, while occupying a substantially smaller memory
footprint.

Instalation:

    PTINT code was written and tested on Linux platform using OpenGL
    Easy Extension (GLee) for extension functions, OpenGL Utility Toolkit
    (GLUT) for interface functions and LCG Toolkit from LCG/COPPE/UFRJ.
    To download and/or see more information about above dependencies see:

    GLee: http://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee
    GLUT: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut
    LCG-Toolkit: http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk

    In order to proper compile the PTINT code, the GLee and GLUT should be
    on a default include directory: GL/; and the LCG Toolkit should be in
    HOME/lcgtk.  The Makefile can be optionally edited to reflect specific
    configurations.

Usage:

    PTINT program is designed to run using a GPU that supports OpenGL
    Shading language.  It has been tested on a GeForce 6800 series.

    Command line: ./ptint 'volume'

    PTINT program searches by default a directory with volume
    information named: ../tet_offs/.  For example, run it by calling:

    $ ./ptint spx2

    and it will search for: ../tet_offs/spx2.off.  Additionally, files
    named spx2.tf and spx2.lmt will also be opened in the same directory.
    If they don't exist, they will be computed and created.  The only
    required file is the volume itself: ../tet_offs/'volume'.off.

File Formats:

    .off   -   Model file ( vertex position and tetrahedra ids )
    .tf    -   Transfer Function file
    .lmt   -   limits file ( maxEdgeLength, maxZ and minZ values )
