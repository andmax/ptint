This project is the source code for the paper: "GPU-Based Cell Projection for Interactive Volume Rendering" available in:

http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2006.22

The code is implemented using C/C++ and GLSL.  The algorithm is called PTINT: Project Tetrahedra with Partial Pre-Integration.  The improved version of PTINT, called IPTINT, is inside the subdirectory iptint/.  The IPTINT project is the source code for the subsequent paper: "Volume and Isosurface Rendering with GPU-Accelerated Cell Projection" available in:

http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01038.x

The code is also implemented using C/C++ and GLSL.  The algorithm is called IPTINT: Improved Project Tetrahedra with Partial Pre-Integration.
