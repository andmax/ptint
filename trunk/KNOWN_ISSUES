Issues:

    PTINT is a research project under development, presenting several
    known problems.  The improved PTINT version, called IPTINT, is not
    integrated within the original PTINT, being in a separate
    subdirectory iptint/.  IPTINT adds isosurface rendering to PTINT
    by using gradients.  This improved version is its early stages of
    development, presenting several bugs on its source code.
